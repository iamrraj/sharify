# sharify
## Project description
Sharify's goal is to create a platform which will allow its users to share an Uber or taxi drive.
The platform will let you post the information about when, from and where are you going to move by taxi or participate to an already planned ride.
It will also allow you to automatically divide the payment. Payments on the platform will be processed using a credit card or cash (for the hackathon we will just mockup a very simple payment processors because we don't have access to any sandobox or real payment processors APIs).
